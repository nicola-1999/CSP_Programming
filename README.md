# CSP_Programming

Hi everyone,
In this repo, I will show you some exercises that I've done during my Master's Course in Artificial Intelligence. In particular, we will focus on the other side of AI, which involves Logic Programming, Optimization Algorithms, and Constraint Optimization, instead of ML or Deep Learning.

In addition, we will use a specific software based on Prolog, called Eclipse Prolog. If you are curious, check out the documentation: https://eclipseclp.org/.
